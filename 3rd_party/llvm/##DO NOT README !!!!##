Please compile LLVM static-linked libraries on your machine.

Brief Steps:

1. Download LLVM Package from http://code.google.com/p/softart/downloads/list 
	## NOTE:
	##   The URL supply a modification of offical svn version for fixing some defects of compilation on vs2010 )
	
2. Use CMake For configurating projects.

3. Build generated LLVM solution using MSVC. We suggest the configuration "MinSizeRel" for your building.
	## NOTE:
	##   Apr 25, 2010 UPDATED:
	##   If some file compiling lead to vs2010 cl.exe crashed, please ignoring and report it.
	
4. Copy all of libraries and binaries(toolchains) to corresponding folder

5. Copy the "$(build)/include/llvm" folder to "bin/include/$(platform)". And $(build) folder is the configuration files folder create by cmake, $(platform) folder is a configuration name such as "win32_msvc10".

6. compile sasl2. 

7. Enjoy it!
